# Hello, my name is Derqui Sanhueza! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a Computer Science Engineering student with a Bachelor's degree in Science in Engineering. I'm from the beautiful country of Chile. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±

Thanks to this experience, I am familiar with a wide range of technologies, which allows me to adapt to different environments and challenges.
