# Hello, my name is Derqui Sanhueza! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a Computer Science Engineering student with a Bachelor's degree of Science in Engineering. I'm from the beautiful country of Chile. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±

My experience in the field of computer engineering is broad and diverse. I have had the opportunity to participate in all stages of a project, from the conception of the idea and economic assessment to its implementation and deployment.

Thanks to this experience, I am familiar with a wide range of technologies, which allows me to adapt to different environments and challenges.
